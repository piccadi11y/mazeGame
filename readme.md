# Procedural Maze Game

A visually simple maze game built with procedural levels in mind. Built to be my first public facing TypeScript project.

### Live version
A live version of the game will be available [here](https://piccadi11y.com/Programming/Games/Browser/Maze/index.html) on my website. Until I finish building the basic game this version will rarely be up to date, but it will always be in a functional state.
